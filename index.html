        Sri Venkateswara Temple is also known as the Temple of Seven Hills as it is located on the Tirupati peak. Besides, the temple has another name derived from the incarnation of Lord Vishnu, which is called Tirupati Balaji. The temple is considered to be the abode of Vishnu on Earth.
        Lord Sri Venkateswara, also known as Srinivasa, Balaji, and Veṅkaṭachalapati, made Tirumala his abode five thousand years ago. Even before him, it was Lord Varahaswami who had made Tirumala his abode. Since then, many devotees have continued to construct grand entrances on the ramparts of the temple over generations.
